# DNA Pattern Recognition

Human DNAs are a long sequence of characters with hidden patterns that can not be easily predicted. Particularly if there are specific set of human classes associated to each type of DNA. For this purpose, a specific research paper has been published known as K-mers counting in DNA pattern recognition that makes it very easy for the Data Scicence community to predict the class of human on the basis of their given DNAs.

In the given notebook, I have tried to solve the same problem using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier using Bag of Words model in Natural Language Processing. The confitional Probability given one event, occurence of second one really boosts the performance of the model.
